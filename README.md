# Security Assessment with NMAP

**Overview**

This portfolio showcases my practical skills, analytical thinking, and communication abilities as a cybersecurity analyst. It is intentionally structured to serve two main purposes:
* Recruiter-Facing Portfolio: Clearly demonstrates my capabilities, thought process, and documentation skills in cybersecurity tasks.
* Beginner-Friendly Guide: Designed to help new cybersecurity learners understand Nmap from the ground up in a clear and accessible way, without feeling overwhelmed.

The focus is not just on running commands, but on why they are used, what the results mean, and how they support security decisions.

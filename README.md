# Security Assessment with NMAP

**Overview**

This portfolio demonstrates my practical skills, analytical thinking, and communication ability as a cybersecurity analyst. It is intentionally structured to serve two purposes:
* Recruiter‑facing portfolio: Clearly shows what I can do, how I think, and how I document security work.
* Beginner‑friendly guide: Helps new cybersecurity learners understand Nmap from the ground up without being overwhelmed.
The focus is not just on running commands, but on why they are used, what the results mean, and how they support security decisions.
